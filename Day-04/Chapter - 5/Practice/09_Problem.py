# Can you change the value inside a list which is contained in set S?
s = {8,7,12,"Harry",[1,2]}

#No, you cannot include a list (or any mutable object like a dictionary) inside a set in Python. This is because sets require their elements to be immutable (i.e., unchangeable), and lists are mutable (i.e., you can change their contents).
